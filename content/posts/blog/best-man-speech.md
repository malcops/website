# Write the thing

Plan for an early laugh. This line is 100% guaranteed to receive applause, allowing you to settle in:
"First and foremost, I'd like to comment on how amazing <the bride> looks today. Could we give her a round of applause?"

Aim for 3-5 minutes max.

Everyone's writing style is different, but I like to get a speech on the page first, then ruthlessly edit afterwards.

Write in deliberate "(PAUSES)" and "(ACTIONS)" in bold font, very helpful if your nerves take over the day of.

Have somebody else review the speech, the best case scenario would be somebody that knows the bride and groom closely,
but is unable to attend the wedding.

Great ideas here:

# Rehearse and prepare

Run through the speech as many times as possible from a paper or cue cards. Have a stopwatch handy.

Edit as you go. Any awkward phrases should be reworded now. If you find youself pausing, or doing an action,
write it in! Print as many drafts of the speech as you need.

Rehearse standing up as much as you can. Practice looking away from the paper while delivering your lines.

In advance of the event, introduce yourself to the emcee, make sure they know your name and how to pronounce it.
Also try to get the order of speakers. You can start your speech by thanking the emcee (by name),
and perhaps the person(s) preceding your speech.

Print two hard copies of your speech. Put one in your suit pocket, and give the backup copy to your date (or somebody you trust).
Email yourself a copy for your records, and in case of serious emergency you can refer to your phone.

# Set yourself up for success

If possible, take 5 minutes and stand behind the microphone prior to the reception. Place your speech
on the podium the same way you will later on. Make note of any tables (e.g. groom's parents) that you
might want to make eye contact with or gestures to later on. Bonus points for a quick sound check into
the microphone.

Find 5 minutes during the day to run through the speech a couple times in your head.

Take it easy on the drinks. By all means, have fun during the day, but tone it down a couple hours
before the speech. Any slurring will be more noticeable talking into a microphone.

# Deliver

You've done everything you can to prepare, so speak with confidence! Remember that everyone
attending the wedding wants to have a great time, and see you succeed.

Take a drink or glass of water up with you. Once you're at the podium, wait long enough for everybody to get settled.

Move one finger down the page as you go. Nobody is going to judge you for reading off a page, but try to make it as
natural as during rehearsals.

After the toast, give the bride and groom a hug, then grab a drink! You've earned it.
