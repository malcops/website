Founded in 2017.

A 5 piece band with a sound inspired by artists such as The Band, Blue Rodeo, The Sheepdogs and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
The name stems from our geographical roots and is an ode to our small-town, blue-collar philosophy. We make 
music for the Canadian working class, because that's who we are!

In 2019 we released "Test Drive", a 5-song album which was written and recorded in-house.
Now available on all major streaming platforms.
