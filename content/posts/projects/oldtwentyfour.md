Founded in 2017.

A 5 piece band with a sound inspired by artists such as The Band, Blue Rodeo, The Sheepdogs and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
The name stems from our geographical roots and is an ode to our small-town, blue-collar philosophy. We make 
music for the Canadian working class, because that's who we are!

In 2019 we released "Test Drive", a 5-song album written and recorded in-house.

In 2021, a follow-up album, [The Shedheads](https://open.spotify.com/album/6e6poetxNJseqUZVlmsAi5).

In 2023, featured on [Jakobian Red's](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7diExcxIfJwKJG4jbOT7l0) second album, [Seers and the May Queen](https://open.spotify.com/album/3sGajMx3TpRThfJZs4UzS4).

Available on all major streaming platforms, or check us out on YouTube: [Castles Made of Sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J65SYgB9QeYv0)
