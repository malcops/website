Start with a raw piece of cuben fiber (Dyneema), in this case approximately 12"x16". Fold and tape the corners with transfer tape.

Add tape across the top.

Cut a piece of drawcord, about 10 inches longer than the width of the cuben fiber. Fold over the exposed transfer tape, leaving room for the drawcord to move.

Tape and fold the bottom twice, first on the interior of the stuff sack, and then again on what will be the exterior.

One single fold up the side using transfer tape.

Add a circle sticker for extra strength, and then install the cord lock.
