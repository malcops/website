## Background

https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome

## Week 1

Introduction, downloading course materials.
Implement basic logic gates using HDL language and hardware emulator.
And
Or
Xor
Mux
Dmux

## Week 2

Half adders, full adders and arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

## Week 3

Memory devices starting at basic register. Flip flop can be constructed from 2 NAND gates with outputs feeding back into inputs. 

## Week 4

Wrote 2 programs in the Hack assembly language. Interact with SCREEN and KBD registers for user input.

## Week 5

Integrated ALU from Week 2 to create full CPU. Integrated CPU with ROM and Memory from Week 3 to create a full computer. 

## Week 6

Wrote an assembler in high-level language (Python), to translate Hack assembly code into binary code.
